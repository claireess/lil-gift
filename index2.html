I wanted it to be meaningful and speacial for you. After all, you deserve absolutely the best, everything of good in this whole world. You are an amazing girl and I couldn't be any more grateful to have in my life. Thank you for being so kind and gentle to me all the time. You're an angel that just appeared in my life out of nowhere. I plan to keep you in my life, if you'll have me. Well, I don't really know what to say, but I hope you know just how happy you make me and how much I appreciate you. I love you, NAME. So, you said you'd give me something on 31/12/2025, correct? (but i'm giving this to you earlier haha) So, I decided to give you this. It wouldn't be nice if you gave me something and I didn't give you anything in return, right? Anyways... It's so interesting how people can simply appear in your life and change it so quickly, isn't it? Hahah, I still can't believe on how fast everything happened, but it's not all bad, actually. I already like you so much. So...\n\nMy dear Ania...\n\n...\n...\n...\n\nWould you be my girlfriend? (yes / no)");

    scenes.push("Oh, my god! OH MY GODDD! I AM SO HAPPY! You just made me the happiest girl alive!\n\nI love you, my sweet girl.\nWith love,\nYour very new girlfriend, Clarice. <3");
